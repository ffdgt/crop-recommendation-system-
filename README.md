Here is a well-structured, professional README you can use for your GitHub repository. It includes a project description, setup instructions, usage guide, and more to present your Crop Recommendation System clearly:

# Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning-based crop recommendation web application that suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental parameters. The app is built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for farmers and agricultural researchers.

---

## Features

- Predicts the best crop based on soil and weather features: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH level, and Rainfall.
- Interactive and elegant web interface with clean design.
- Responsive layout for desktops and mobile devices.
- Uses a trained Random Forest model for predictions.
- Modular codebase with clear separation of model, templates, and static resources.
- Easy to extend and customize.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop_recommendation_project.git
cd crop_recommendation_project
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

```
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

3. Enter the soil and environmental parameters in the form and submit to get crop recommendations.

## Model Training

The Random Forest model was trained on a dataset containing soil nutrient values and climate features mapped to crops.

To retrain the model or experiment with other models, open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder and run the cells step-by-step.
